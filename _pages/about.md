I am a Research Assistant in the Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am also pursuing first year of my masters degree program in Environmental Engineering at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in the beautiful Haidian District in the province of Beijing, China.

I am planning on researching the physio-chemical wastewater treatment, particularly the advance processes in membrane technology to tackle emerging micropollutants. I am especially interested in the utilization of integrative treatment operations for membrane processess to effectively deal with water contaminants for large-scale implementation.
