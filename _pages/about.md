I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria on beautiful Vancouver Island in the province of British Columbia, where I lead the Climate Dynamics Laboratory.

I research the physical climate system, particularly the myriad of interactions between atmosphere, ocean, and ice that give rise to the Earthâ€™s climate. I am especially interested in the ever-evolving climate of the polar regions, both Antarctic and Arctic, as well as the large-scale transport of atmospheric water from equator to pole.

I am a co-chair of the Polar Climate Working Group of the Community Earth System Model, whose development hub is at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, USA.
